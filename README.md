# FEEDREADER

Feedreader.js is designed to provide a test driven development approach to creating web app.  Its current form was written for a particular project, however can be modified to provide a TDD approach to similar apps.  Feedreader is written in Jasmine, a popular JavaScript testing suite.


# IMPLEMENTATION

The repository is located at https://github.com/wade1928/Feedreader.  From here you may either download Feedreader as a zip file, or clone the repository to your local machine.  Just click the drop down menu "Clone or download" to make your choice.  Once the project is on your local machine, you can either use Feedreader as a reference for creating your own testing suite, or you can modify feedreader.js and/or the documents in your app to work together.


# FUNCTIONALITY

The version of Feedreader that is available checks an RSS feed page to make sure JSON data is present, and also checks the integrity of the data. It also checks various functionality of the app, as well as if the data actually updates correctly. Feedreader is designed so the tests are written first, and then you come up with code to make the tests pass.


# CONCLUSION

I hope you enjoy my version of this project and it brings some joy and happiness to your life.  Althought this is my first experience with Jasmine, I see that test driven development is the way to go, and Jasmine is a great tool to help in your TDD journey. Happy coding and never stop learning!
